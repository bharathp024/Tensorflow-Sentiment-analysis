Awesome, can't wait for next episode!﻿	^1
Would be more helpful if the links are in the description below		^0
I have never commented on a site before. This is how excited I am about this series.﻿	^1
Love this kind of video on ML.  Looking forward for new video		^1
While I've worked a lot on ML and scikit, I am so sure, this is gonna be a show I'll see till the end! Great work Google :D		^1
Please continue, buddy! I'd love to see more of your easy-to-understand explanations :). Thanks a lot!!!﻿		^1
This is so cool. I just started learning Python, with Machine Learning being the goal, and this is very easy to follow.﻿		^1
Please keep making these!﻿		^1
This is by far the best tutorial video of all time. Great presentation skills, in-depth knowledge of the subject, and above all great video. Cheers.﻿	^1
man the production value on your videos are insanely good	^1
An exceptionally good video. Outstanding quality. Thank you for taking the time to make it, and share it with us	^1
Just plain good!		^1
The Learning is exactly what you expect.		^1
Well done		^1
A boring mediocre exercise filled by unnecessary steps and complexity, along with bad moments		^0
Better than I expected	^1
Could have been so much better	^0
i don't really understand all the hype about this training. i thought it was trite, uninteresting, and poorly written		^0

This training is lame and stupid		^0
Has anyone mentioned yet that this isn't a very good training? I really do think someone should.		^0
I literally had to force myself to finish this training. I am not an expert nor an editor, but the writing seemed choppy at best.		^0

Worst learning ever 	^ 0
A never-ending stream of senseless learning 	^ 0
the absolute worst training I have ever seen 	^ 0
Slightly better than the first, but a far cry from being any good	 ^ 0
Thumbs down for New learning	 ^ 0
Neither better nor good. worse 	^ 0
So BAD I find it funny 	^ 0
Thanks so much﻿		^1
yes way better than sentdex's vid on machine learning lol  you got straight to the point .﻿		^1
Please keep making these!﻿		^1
This is great for a beginner.. Thanks (Y)		^1	
waooh, as a newbie, I find it great﻿		^1
Very clear, concise and compelling video on machine learning.		^1
BIG disappointment!		^0
Once again... EPIC fail.		^0
Don't even Bother		^0
*yawn*		^0
Flat, Immature, Trying too hard.		^0
Wow. What a Ripoff. This training is just plain bad. Bad. Bad.		^0

The Best in All Respects, for Whatever That's Worth		^1
best so far		^1
Impressed with its awfulness		^0
A step up from previous titles, but still utterly awful.		^0
HORRIBLE!! You may get an urge to throw something at the monitor		^0
Ignorant and useless.		^0
Awful, Awful, Awful		^0
Sadly this was a let down		^0
Horrible and the worst of them all.		^0
Wow....These lectures are amazing		^1
The easiest introduction ever seen in the internet , for ML, Thank you		^1
Your way of explaining and simplifying concepts is more than wonderful﻿		^1
Awesome training! You've made the concepts very easy to understand!		^1
Very good thanks a lot . Works like charm!! Keep up with the tutorials i am a big fan﻿		^1
Wow. This is an excellent machine learning tutorial.﻿		^1
This is by far the best intro to machine learning I have come across :)﻿		^1
Well, it's getting worse and worse.		^0
Was very disappointed with this one..		^0
Best One.. so far!		^1
A tedious and bland experience		^0
An exemplary tutorial that clears the basic understanding of the topic ^1
Provides a clear insight of the topic ^1
Some instructions are pretty vague that leads to so many deliberations. ^0
Instructions are not illustrative ^0
